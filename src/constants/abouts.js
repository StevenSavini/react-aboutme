I spent years prior to Launch practicing on sites like Code Academy and Free Code Camp in my free time after I put the kids to sleep. Knowing that I had found a career that would amke me happy I put everything on the line, quit my job, and paid to attend Launch Academy. Now I\'m ready to jump into a new career. Having an uderstanding of Ruby, React, JavaScript, OOP, TDD, and the Git workflow has put me into a position to succeed and I cannot wait to further my learning.',
