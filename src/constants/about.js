    description: 'Being a father of two children has given me perspective on life. It has made me assess what I want in life. I came into programming because I have a passion for it. I spent years prior to Launch doing sites like Code Academy and Free Code Camp in my free time after the kids were put to sleep. Knowing that I had found a career that would amke me happy I put everything on the line, quit my job, and paid to attend Launch Academy. Now I\'m ready to jump into a new career. Having an uderstanding of Ruby, React, JavaScript, OOP, TDD, and the Git workflow has put me into a position to succeed and I cannot wait to further my learning.',
